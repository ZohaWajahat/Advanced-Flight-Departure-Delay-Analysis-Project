# Advanced-Flight-Departure-Delay-Analysis-Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting and analyzing flight departure delays. The project leverages Python, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to address challenges in the aviation industry, such as delay management and operational efficiency. The project is part of the AI-3002 Machine Learning course and adheres to the provided guidelines for structured development.

## Project Overview
Flight delays are a critical challenge in the aviation industry, affecting passenger satisfaction, airline operations, and overall efficiency. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict and analyze departure delays based on historical flight and weather data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, EDA, and building classification and regression models to predict delay durations.

## Objectives
• Preprocess and clean flight and weather datasets.
• Analyze patterns and correlations affecting departure delays.
• Develop predictive models to classify and predict delay durations.
• Use meaningful visualizations to support insights.
• Submit results to Kaggle competitions for evaluation.

## Phases
### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
#### • Data Integration
• Combine flight and weather datasets for analysis.
#### • Data Cleaning
• Handle missing values and standardize time fields.
#### • Feature Engineering
• Calculate departure delays.
• Extract temporal features (e.g., day of the week, hour of the day).
• Merge relevant weather attributes (e.g., temperature, wind speed).
